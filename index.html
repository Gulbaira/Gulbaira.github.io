                <p class="container1-title">Bright Lights</p>
                <p class="conatiner1-text">Bright Lights is a multi-Grammy nominated singer, songwriter, DJ and record
                    producer. She has written for
                    numerous

                    pop stars including Britney Spears, Justin Bieber, Usher and Beyoncé. Her catalog has amassed over 1
                    billion streams worldwide. More than 100 million of those streams can be attributed to her artist
                    career
                    and include such hits as Porter Robinson's "Language," 3LAU's "How You Love Me" and her own single
                    "Runaway." She was also a featured vocalist on Zedd's #1 Clarity album. Her latest music video, "Put
                    It
                    Down," reached 1 million streams in the first week, releasing independently. Bright Lights is
                    currently
                    in the studio working on a self-produced album slated for release in 2020. </p>

                <p>“In an age where mainstream music is designed to be as
                    easily consumed as possible, listening to Bright Lights is
                    refreshing, to say the least. Her sound is perfect for radio
                    but complex enough to separate her from other pop newcomers.”</p>
